  # This module is private to TaskBunny and should not be accessed directly.

  # JobRunner wraps up job execution and provides you abilities:
  #
  # - invoking jobs concurrently (unblocking job execution)
  # - handling a job crashing
  # - handling timeout
  #
  # ## Signal
  #
  # Once the job has finished it sends a message with a tuple consisted with:
  #
  # - atom indicating message type: :job_finished
  # - result: :ok or {:error, details}
  # - meta: meta data for the job
  #
  # After sending the messsage, JobRunner shuts down all processes it started.
